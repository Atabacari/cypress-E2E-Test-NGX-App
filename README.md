# Cypress Demo Project

This is my demo project to demonstrate my knowledge in automated testing with Cypress and real-world usage of Cypress testing methods, patterns, and workflows. 



## Project Description

The project is focused on testing various web elements such as accordions, buttons, input fields, datepickers, forms, popover,steppers, and others. 
The tests were written using Cypress to automate interactions.
The code is organized and reusable, following the Page Object design pattern.
The project includes the report function too.
